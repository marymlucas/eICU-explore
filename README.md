# eICU-explore

A repo containing my initial explorations of the eICU patient database.

To learn more about this data and how to get access to it, please see [https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/](https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/). It is freely available but each user needs to go through a credentialing process before being granted access.  Details on that are on the [Getting Started](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/gettingstarted/) page.


## Data 
Following and adapting the steps outlined in [https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/gettingstarted/access/](https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/gettingstarted/access/).  I have loaded the eICU data into PostgreSQL database running on my local machine.
