# eICU-explore

A repo containing my initial explorations of the eICU patient database - [https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/](https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/). The data is freely available but each user needs to go through a credentialing process before being granted access.  Details on that are on the [Getting Started](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/gettingstarted/) page.


## Data 
Following and adapting the steps outlined in [https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/tutorials/install_eicu_locally/](https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/tutorials/install_eicu_locally/),  I have loaded the eICU data into PostgreSQL database running on my local machine.
